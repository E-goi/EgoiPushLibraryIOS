## Requirements

To use this library you must have Firebase configured in your app. [Don't know how to do it? Read this article](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client).
<br><small><b>Note:</b> Since the main objective of this library is to handle push notifications, the only Pod that is required for it to work is `pod 'Firebase/Messaging'`.</small>

You must have an APNs key inserted on the Firebase App. [Read more here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/certs).

You must have an [E-goi account](https://login.egoiapp.com/signup/email) with a [Push application configured](https://helpdesk.e-goi.com/650296-Integrar-o-E-goi-com-a-app-m%C3%B3vel-da-minha-empresa-para-enviar-push).

You must have the following properties inserted in your Info.plist:
* Required background modes
   - App registers for location updates
   - App processes data in the background
   - App downloads content in response to push notifications
* Privacy - Location Always and When In Use Usage Description
* Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description

## Installation

EgoiPushLibrary is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'EgoiPushLibrary'
```

After installing, you can initialize the library in the **AppDelegate.swift** with following instruction:

**Note:** Your AppDelegate should extend our EgoiAppDelegate instead of the UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate. If you are using a SceneDelegate, you must also extend ou EgoiSceneDelegate. This is a way for us to process logic so you don't have to, like processing the received remote notifications, and it allows us to display Alerts in your app.

```swift
import EgoiPushLibrary

class AppDelegate: EgoiAppDelegate {

    func application(
        _ application: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
    ) -> Bool {
        FirebaseApp.configure()
        Messaging.messaging().delegate = self
            
        EgoiPushLibrary.shared.config(
            appId: /* (string) (required) */,
            apiKey: /* (string) (required) */,
            geoEnabled: /* (boolean) (optional / defaults to true) */,
            dialogCloseLabel: /* (string) (optional / defaults to "Close") */
        )
            
        return true
    }
}
```

Still in the **AppDelegate.swift**, you can send the Firebase token to the library with the following code:

```swift
extension AppDelegate : MessagingDelegate {
    
    public func messaging(
        _ messaging: Messaging,
        didReceiveRegistrationToken fcmToken: String?
    ) {
        guard let token = fcmToken else {
            return
        }
        
        EgoiPushLibrary.shared.addFCMToken(token: token)
    }
}
```

### Configurations

#### EgoiPushLibrary.shared.config()

Responsible for initializing the library. The call of this method is required.

</table>

#### EgoiPushLibrary.shared.addFCMToken()

You should call this method everytime a new Firebase token is generated. The token is saved on the library and, if the user is already registered on your E-goi list, updates the token automatically.

   <th>Type</th>

   <td>token</td>
   <td>String</td>
   <td>The token generated by Firebase.</td>
   <td>true</td>
   <td>---</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### EgoiPushLibrary.shared.processNotification()

This method processes the received remote notification. If the remote notification is a geopush, creates a geofence that triggers a local notification when the user enters teh region. If it is a normal notification, shows the notification and opens a dialog with the actions defined in E-goi when the user opens thr notification banner.

This method is already called inside the didReceiveRemoteNotification implemented in **EgoiAppDelegate.swift**.

### Actions

#### EgoiPushLibrary.shared.requestForegroundLocationAccess()

Requests the user permission to access the location when the app is in the foreground (displaying on screen).

#### EgoiPushLibrary.shared.requestBackgroundLocationAccess()

Requests the user permission to access the location when the app is in background (minimized or closed).

#### EgoiPushLibrary.shared.sendToken()

Registers the Firebase token on the E-goi list. You only need to call this method once, after that, the library automatically updates the E-goi's list contact with the new tokens.
